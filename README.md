# AT32 Peripheral Access Crates

### Artery32 device support crates.

This repository was forked from [https://github.com/stm32-rs/stm32-rs](stm32-rs) for generating device support crate for use with specific chip AT32F407.
In future, this repository may be extended to support other Artery microcontrollers.
